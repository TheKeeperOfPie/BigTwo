BigTwo is an Android application based on the Big 2 card game, created as a side project for a group of friends, and maybe will eventually be published to the Play Store. It utilizes OpenGL ES 2.0 to render the game and Google's TurnBasedMultiplayer system to sync matches between players.

Current Features:
- Inviting multiple players from Google+ circles to play a match
- Three tab setup of my turn, their turn, and finished matches
- Custom card and suit orders
- Swipe gestures to perform actions:
    - Left to right to skip turn
    - Down to up to play hand
    - Up to down past bottom of screen to toggle hand visibility
- Ability to show played cards
- Basic winner's screen
